Im going to start by saying this project was tough and I have a lot of bugs to still debug.
I didnt have enough timw to hash out some of the segmentation faults and bad alloc errors, but 
if you try to run it multiple times it will eventually work so please bear with me.

My implementation of pokemon encounters works flawlessly. To start the user chooses the pokemon
they want to start the battle with. For there they use the up and down keys to select their move.
They continue to do this until one of the pokemon has fainted. If the pc's pokemon has fainted the
user can either flee, choose another pokemon or revive the pokemon right there(choose to do this instead
of just leaving). If the opponents pokemon faints first then the user has the oppurtunity to open its inventory
and catch the pokemon. My pokemon fight works really well. For my trainer fights I was very low on time with. Its not
as clear as my other fights. When one of the trainer or pc's pokemon all faint the fight is over by trying to switch to an 
already fainted pokemon. If you try to fight with all fainted pokemon the fight instantly ends. 

Lastly, I wasnt able to incorporate the 'B' command, but I was planning on doing thay for next weeks assignment, sorry.

Please help me out  :/
