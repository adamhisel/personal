# Personal Repository README

Welcome to my personal repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my development experience, technical skills, and interest in full-stack software engineering. Feel free to explore the projects and code samples provided here.

## About Me

I recently graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics, earning Magna Cum Laude honors. I have experience with both frontend and backend technologies, including React, Node.js, Next.js, Java, Python, C++, and database management with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. I enjoy solving real-world problems through collaborative development, agile workflows, and building applications that are both functional and user-friendly.

## Projects

### Learn-X (AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform)
An AI-driven project developed to address gaps in higher education by personalizing course materials using AI personas. This full-stack platform was built with Next.js, Docker, OpenAI APIs, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques, and was developed collaboratively with a team of 5 students.

### Pokémon Game (C++)
A text-based C++ implementation of a retro Pokémon-style game, utilizing ASCII characters for visuals and attributes. Developed as a semester-long academic project with an emphasis on memory management and object-oriented design.

### Basketball Shot Plotter & Stat Sheet
An Android app developed in Java using Android Studio for the front end and IntelliJ for backend logic. It tracks and visualizes basketball stats for teams, with MySQL integration and Git-based version control for team collaboration.

### Titan Lifts (Workout Web App)
A full-stack workout tracking application built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to log and view personal workout routines with a clean, responsive interface.

### Touchmark Catalog Page
A simple front-end project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a mock online product catalog.
